# MPQ3426_Boost_Converter

I made this 3.7V to 12V boost board to be able to power little solenoids from lipo packs.  It works as is, but when I get some time I w
ant to tweak some things to try and squeeze some more power out of it.

All caps should be greater than 12V, diode should be at least 3A, and the inductor should have an Isat rating of at least 5.
